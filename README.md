# Woodeco RecSys

**Remarks**  
* Files which has a prefix `_` in its name are python scipts for some experiments of paper.
* This python program encapsulates API secrets by using `.env` files. So, you _should configure it **yourself**_.
* Since Google Translation API and OpenAI API takes elapsed time and money, We use cache data.  
It is worth to implement because almost data for a calculation of API are duplicated!
